# Resist-Game2

Can you resist the ongoing waves of Monsters ?

Trying a simpler way (than first version) to create an online multiplayer RPG game using NodeJS and WebSockets.

## Installing required modules
```
npm install (or updating, when necessary)
```

## Running the code

To be able to run the application locally, some JavaScript files must be created. For this, run the following command in a node terminal.

```
gulp default
```
